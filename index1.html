    For example, let's say you want to run some code when the user tupes into a text box. To do this, you can call the addEventListener() function of the text box. This function expects you to pass it (at least) two parameters:

    -the name of the event to listen for, which in this case is 'keydown'
    -a function to run when the event happens

    When the user presses a key, the browser will call the function you provided, and will pass it a parameter containing information about this event, including the particular key that the user pressed:

   textBox.addEventListener('keydown',function(event){
       console.log(`You pressed "${event.key}".`);

//Solving Fizz Buzz

//Allows user to enter a number-print each number between one and the number entered.
//For numbers that divide by three without remainder print Fizz instead. For numbers ///that divide 5 without a remainder print Buzz and for numbers that divide both 3 and //5 print FizzBuzz

let answer = parseInt(prompt("Please enter the number you would like to FizzBuzz up to: "));

for (let i = 1; i <= answer; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
